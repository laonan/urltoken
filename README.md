# urltoken

## Description
URL Token Encoder simplifies encoding sensitive data like emails and usernames into URL-safe tokens. Unlike encryption, it preserves data integrity for easy retrieval. Ideal for securing information in URLs without encryption complexities.

You can put the encoded token in the URL, and when you need to retrieve the original data, you can decode the token to get the original data.

Features:

* Encode sensitive content into URL-safe tokens.
* Lightweight and easy integration into Python apps.
* Simplifies data security in web apps and APIs.
* Check if the token is generated by the same secret key.


## Installation
   
    pip install urltoken

    
## Usage
    
    from urltoken.encoder import UrlTokenEncoder
    
    encoder =  UrlTokenEncoder('yoursecretkey')
    token = encoder.encode('example@domain.com')
    print(token)

    decoded = encoder.decode(token)
    print(decoded)

## Warning
!!! This library is not intended for encrypting sensitive data, if you need to encrypt data, use a proper encryption library, like `cryptography` or `pycryptodome`.
